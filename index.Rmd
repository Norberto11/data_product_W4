## Overview

The application is an interactive tool that provides:

- Cancer related death rate (deaths per 100,000 population) in US from 1999 and 2014.
- Graphical interaction to display the death rate and predict it for years after 2014. (Linear Regression Model)

Data source: CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) <https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/CancerMort-v2014.html#Age-Adjusted>.

## Data set
Data frame with 16 rows and 52 columns.

```{r dataset, echo=FALSE}
dataset<-read.csv(file="./final_data.csv",sep="",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r head, echo=TRUE,comment=""}
head(dataset[,c(1:8)],10)
```

## Inputs and Outputs

Inputs

- **State** (List of all US states)
- **Year for prediction** (List from 2015 to 2025)
- **Year for all states** graph (List from 1999 to 2014)

Outputs

- Death rate trend **per state** from 1999 to 2014
- **Prediction** death rate for 100,000 population **for the selected state**
- Death rate **for all states** for a selected year

## Graphical Results.
Below the main panel and one of the two types of graphs generated by the application. The graph shows the death rate for the state of Alabama and a linear regression model with 95% confident interval shaded area. At the bottom the prediction for the selected year input.
